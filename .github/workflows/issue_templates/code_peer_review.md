### Review comments

*Insert detailed comments here!*

These might include, but not exclusively:

- bugs that need fixing (does it work as expected? and does it work with other code
  that it is likely to interact with?)
- alternative methods (could it be written more efficiently or with more clarity?)
- documentation improvements (does the documentation reflect how the code actually works?)
- additional tests that should be implemented (do the tests effectively assure that it
  works correctly?)
- code style improvements (could the code be written more clearly?)

Your suggestions should be tailored to the code that you are reviewing.
Be critical and clear, but not mean. Ask questions and set actions.
